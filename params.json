{"name":"Bigqueue","tagline":"A big, fast and persistent queue based on memory mapped file.","body":"# Big Queue\r\n\r\n\r\nA big, fast and persistent queue based on memory mapped file.\r\n\r\n***Notice***, bigqueue is just a standalone library, for a high-throughput, persistent, distributed, publish-subscrible messaging system, please refer to [Luxun](https://github.com/bulldog2011/luxun), Luxun messaging system uses bigqueue internally as fast and persistent queue. \r\n\r\n##Feature Highlight:  \r\n1. **Fast**: close to the speed of direct memory access, both enqueue and dequeue are close to O(1) memory access.  \r\n2. **Big**: the total size of the queue is only limited by the available disk space.  \r\n3. **Persistent**: all data in the queue is persisted on disk, and is crash resistant.\r\n4. **Reliable**: OS will be responsible to presist the produced messages even your process crashes.  \r\n5. **Realtime**: messages produced by producer threads will be immediately visible to consumer threads.\r\n6. **Memory-efficient**: automatic paging & swapping algorithm, only most-recently accessed data is kept in memory.  \r\n7. **Thread-safe**: multiple threads can concurrently enqueue and dequeue without data corruption.  \r\n8. **Simple&Light-weight**: current number of source files is 12 and the library jar is less than 30K.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Big Picture\r\n\r\n###Memory Mapped Sliding Window\r\n\r\n![design](http://bulldog2011.github.com/images/luxun/sliding_window.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Performance Highlight:\r\n* In concurrent producing and consuming case, the average throughput is around ***166M bytes per second***.\r\n* In sequential producing then consuming case, the average throughput is around ***333M bytes per second***.\r\n\r\nSuppose the average message size is 1KB, then big queue can concurrently producing and consuming  \r\n166K message per second. Basically, the throughput is only limited by disk IO bandwidth.\r\n\r\n[here is a detailed performance report](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bigqueue/wiki/Performance-Test-Report)\r\n\r\n##How to Use\r\n1. Direct jar or source reference  \r\nDownload jar from repository mentioned in version history section below, latest stable release is [0.7.0](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bulldog-repo/tree/master/repo/releases/com/leansoft/bigqueue/0.7.0).   \r\n***Note*** : bigqueue depends on log4j, please also added log4j jar reference if you use bigqueue.\r\n\r\n2.
